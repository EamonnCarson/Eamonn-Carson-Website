# Eamonn-Carson-Website
My website. It's not going to be too fancy, since I think I'd rather spend time making 
things rather than designing an amazing website, but it will be functional, and hopefully
it won't be too ugly.

I'm going to incorporate some of the things that I learned with the carson lineage website
into this. Specifically since I'm going to (hopefully) have a lot of pages I'm going to be
using templating. At some point I may upgrade to an actual template system, but so far as
I see it a simple php-based template system should be enough.
